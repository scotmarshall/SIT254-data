## 2. What is a game?
A game is a type of play *activity*, conducted in the context of a pretended *reality*, in which the participant(s) tries to achieve at least one *arbitrary*, *nontrivial goal* by acting in accordance with *rules*. To achieve this definition of a game we need to:

- Outline the objective/victory condition of the game
- Provide meaning to activities and events that occur in the game
- Construct a contextual framework of permitted activities which evaluate action in the game


***Discussion activity***

*Answer the following question, and post your answer for feedback to the Module 1 student discussion:*

*What do you think it means to construct a contextual framework of permitted activity when designing a game?*

***Learning activity***

*You are being asked to post your answers for feedback to the Module 1 student discussion. As a game designer, what would it take to ensure that this action provides value for you as a member of the class? What actions will you be taking to achieve this value?*

*You are being asked to take personal responsibility and explicit actions during this trimester to apply the concepts you learn to create a fun and effective learning environment.*


## 3. Game design origins
Some of the earliest evidence of human play can be found in the board games uncovered in ancient burial grounds or depicted in ancient drawings and carvings. Initially simple folk objects carved into: Earth, wood or stone composition as shown in the figure below.

The oldest games were found at sites of ancient civilizations: Egypt, Cyprus, Palestine, Iraq, Iran and Jordan. They provide many archetypical features we understand as a part of modern games. These include: often games of chance over games of strategy – i.e. chess

### Example: Mancala
Come from the Arabic word ‘nagala’ meaning literally ‘to move’. It is the oldest Neolithic version of a game. Mancala was uncovered in Jordan around 6900 BC. This type of game includes: counting, sowing or capture elements as the main forms of play. Mancala is actually a type of game, not a specific game installation. It was based on prevalent social/cultural activity of the time, which was farming.

Moves in Mancala are created as the players select an indentation between the two rows of indentations, and, one by one, distribute tokens (sowing seeds).

Mancala is the most popular arithmetical game in the world. It can be played as a game of pure chance. However, most people play it strategically by counting the tokens. Mancala is a game of *perfect* information; all game information is known to the player upfront.

The Neolithic period was a revolutionary era in human evolution, during which humans became recognizable Homo sapiens and developed agrarian culture capable of reflecting on the whims of nature and fate. The figure below shows an example carved into rock, with a more modern version to follow.

### What Mancala can tell us?
Being such early evidence of human play, Mancala resembles contemporary games boards by:

- Having territories
- Actions
- Rules
- Tokens
- Feedback

The fact that these early Mancala boards were developed and customised speaks to the aesthetic importance of games and how the play experience has, for thousands of years, been intertwined with aesthetics.

Discussion activity

Answer the following question, and post your answer for feedback to the Module 1 student discussion: 

Why do you think we need to consider the origins of game design when designing video/computer games?

4.                American/Western Games
Devalued until middle 19th century, board game were judged as games, toys, unworthy of preservation! Mass production allowed a resurgence of board games (also cheap cost). The earliest games focused on topics such as: Domestic Life, Home and religious instruction, Economics, War, Abstract Parlor Games, Language.

Discussion activity

Answer the following question, and post your answer for feedback to the Module 1 student discussion

What games do you think helped make games commonplace during the 19th Century?

 

Example: The Landlords Game
Invented by Lizzie Magie the Landlords Games was the first game granted a US patent in 1904. The game is based on political economists work and book entitled ‘progress and poverty’. The game provided mechanics to explore land tax.

In 1924 Magie brought the game to large commercial publishers, Parker Brothers. Magie was told the game was too complicated, educational, political and wasn’t fun. But had a local appeal and obtained a cult following. See below image of the game board, drawn from the 1904 patent.

Discussion activity

Answer the following question, and post your answer for feedback to the Module 1 student discussion 

Does 'the Landlords Game' remind you of any other popular board games? Why? Why not?

 

5.                Why is this all relevant to us?
There is a difference in the play styles and often philosophies of board games and video games. These are:

Board Games

Perfect Information (chess and go)
Imperfect/Partially observable (Games with “hidden” info)
Abstractions of realities
May have spiritual, social or culturally significant aesthetics
Often artistic in implementation
Often implement simple economies
Discrete mechanics (covered further in module 2)
Video Games

Hidden Rules, almost always partially observable with imperfect information
Aesthetics lean towards realism or recreation of reality
Implement complex economies of resources
Continuous mechanics (covered further in module 2)
A key approach to games design, and a focus on this unit, is the design of 'game mechanics'. The topic is covered in further detail below and in module 2.

6.                An approach to games design: Mechanics
In the description of early games, reference was made to the use of 'actions', 'rules' and 'feedback' as a part of the game. Combined these provide game 'mechanics'. Mechanics are the way in which the player interacts with the game, such as taking a turn, making a move or navigating a game space. A mechanic is a combination of action, rules and feedback. A core part of creating a game is to define the 'game mechanics':

Mechanics can be hidden
Mechanics are constructed based on game rules
Core mechanics help a player navigate the game
Mechanics can be media independent (i.e a game is not necessarily electronic)
Review the below video for more detail on defining games and game mechanics.

Answer the following question, and post your answer for feedback to the Module 1 student discussion 

What makes a game unpredictable? What are some example of game mechanics?

 

7.                Being a game designer
A game designer is a person who designs gameplay, conceiving and designing the rules and structures of a game.

 “A game designer is not necessarily a programmer, visual designer, or project manager, although sometimes he or she can also play these roles in the creation of a game. A game designer might work alone or as part of a larger team” (Salen & Zimmerman 2009)

“A good game designer must be able to define a gameplay mechanic, know how it is created, and apply this knowledge to the development of mechanics that are perfect for the game” (Dunniway and Novak 2008).

As a game designer you will be focusing on the games design process. This involves thinking about the game mechanics, artistic and narrative elements, and technical considerations in relation to the game design team. Through iterative design the game designer brings together art and programming to design a user experience.

Games design is an art form. Games design is a challenge. There is a strong and constant need to balance audience expectations as a game designer. This involves understanding what meaningful play/ motivation/ fun mean to your audience, while also managing time and budget restrictions relevant to the situation. The underlined words will be explored through the modules in this unit.

From an IT perspective, we look at the design of games as a gameplay system. This includes:

Designing strong mechanics that facilitate play, yet allow variety of gameplay (avoiding repetition)
Emergent attributes that allow to new, unpredictable, forms of gameplay
Understanding player engagement
Balance of game difficulty and player interest
 

Discussion activity

Read Illusions about being a game designer (https://gamecareerguide.com/features/701/student_illusions_about_being_a_.php?page=2) before continuing.

Answer the following question, and post your answer for feedback to the Module 1 student discussion 

Investigate 3 different game designers of your choice. What makes them good? What is their process of game design? Note down your research addressing the following in a short presentation: Name, Company (past and present), current working title, titles worked on, game design philosophy.

8.                Anatomy of being a game designer
There are many potential roles in game design. Review games industry job roles (https://www.screenskills.com/job-profiles/browse/games/) to get the full picture. Of important to this class, we will focus on the following roles.

Lead game designer
Environment designer
Script programming/ designer
Game tester
A lead game designer is a visionary, they need to consider whole game design. The need to have: good communication skills, oral presentation skills and be creative. In addition, they need to be technically and artistically astute, be able to write, and consider level and environmental design elements.

Specific to environment design the game designer will consider the creation of digital space and design and model virtual game environment (from the art concept). The environmental designer will design and implement game content via a brief. They are technically astute in 3D applications and reports to lead designer

The script programming/ designer creates scripts for game functions and reports to lead designer

Finally, a game tester, tests gameplay and checks game balance. Undervalued member, but important!

Discussion activity

Answer the following question, and post your answer for feedback to the Module 1 student discussion 

What do you think makes a good game designer?

 

9.                Conclusion
This module has provided a reflection on history of games. History can show patterns, reasons for change and important knowledge which we can take into our designs of today. How can we continue to push the envelope in our games design? One way is via innovation via reflection on what was.

Being a game designer is a multifaceted role. You need to be both technically astute and creative. In SIT254 you will have the opportunity to build and flex your technical and creative skills through exploration and application of game mechanics into a game prototype. 

Where to from here?
Reflect on this module, then consider the answer the following question via a post to the Module 1 student discussion 

 

"What role do you think you could fill when working on a game design and development project? Why do you think you can complete this role? Can you undertake more than 1 role?" Your answer is an important first step in forming teams for your assignment 2.
